        <h1>How?</h1>
        <p style="background-color: #ff7f50;">The Dutch had a lot of money and tulips were recently imported. Due to disease in some tulips, they had intrinsic colors throughout the petals. Various Dutch citizens bought and helped the prices rise. Tulips eventually increased to where each tulip was around 100 to 1000 guilders. 1 guilder in today's markets is worth 0.44 USD.</p>
        <h1>Why?</h1>
        <p style="background-color: #d31fd3;">Tulips rose in price due to stock and demand. The tulips were seen as a rare prize and especially the Semper August tulip (See the home page for photos).</p>
        <h1>When?</h1>
        <p style="background-color: #e7e124;">In the mid-17th century the tulip mania took place. This was after the 30 years war in which the Dutch didn't participate. Because of this, the Dutch were in their golden age and progressed as a country by a substantial amount. Tulips then took a rise due to sheer luck in the game of supply and demand in 1637. Then the price dropped in a month.</p>
